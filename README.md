# SQL-Query-Projects
This repository contains all the SQL projects i have completed for my personal portfolio. All the queries have been used either to answer a business question or establish a solution to a problem. They have all been visualised in Tableau, which can be seen on my portfolio website. 

The current SQL projects found here are:

	1) Covid-19 data query
		The Covid-19 case study was done to idetify different parameters worlwide and visualise the finding therafter.

	2) Solar potential query 
		I was very interested in doing something very different and thus decided to do some digging into this sloar potential project for the USA. It shows the potential solar installations with regard to adequate sunlight, roof space availability and existing installs.
